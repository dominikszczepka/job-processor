const SalaryObjective = `**Salary Prioritization (CRITICAL):**\n    * **First, check for explicitly defined salary fields:** Look for \`Salary\`, \`grossSalary\`, \`netSalary\`, \`gross_salary\`, \`net_salary\`, or similar fields within the raw data.\n    * **If \`grossSalary\` (or a similar gross salary field) is present:**  Use the \`min\` and \`max\` values from that field.  The \`currency\` and \`period\` should also be taken from the associated data if available.  Set \`salary.type\` to \"GROSS\".  **This takes absolute precedence.**\n    * **If \`netSalary\` (or a similar net salary field) is present, but no \`grossSalary\`:** Use the \`min\` and \`max\` values from that field.  The \`currency\` and \`period\` should also be taken from the associated data if available. Set \`salary.type\` to \"NET\".\n    * **Only if *no* explicit salary fields are found:** Fall back to inferring salary information from the job description.  If inferring from the description, attempt to identify a salary range and currency, but prioritize accuracy and avoid making assumptions. Use standard 3-letter currency codes (e.g., "USD", "EUR"). Standardize salary periods (e.g., "yearly", "monthly", "hourly").`;
